# Discovery

## What is Discovery?
Discovery is about conducting user research to understand people's needs. Discovery helps define a service’s potential users and how their needs can be met. You shouldn’t start building your service in Discovery.

## What do you do in Discovery?

In Discovery you will:

- conduct user research
- learn about the people who will use the service
- ask users what they want in a service
- check if there are existing or non-governmental services that meet user needs
- identify policies and other barriers that will make meeting user needs difficult
- conduct a policy review using the [Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+)](https://cfc-swc.gc.ca/gba-acs/course-cours-en.html) framework to assess how diverse groups of women, men and non-binary people along with other identity factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, age, and mental or physical disability may experience or be impacted by your service differently.
- identify how impairments might affect your users -- for example, visual, hearing, motor and cognitive (memory and thinking) impairments
- document the research and findings through artefacts such as journey maps, service blueprints and personas.

## Staffing the team
[TBD]

## What do you have at the end of Discovery?

By the end of Discovery, expect to have:

- a clear understanding of the problems that the service will address
- a documented set of user needs and stories
- a plan for what will be prototyped and tested in Alpha
- a team of people and list of what resources you need to support work in Alpha
- current benchmarks of service performance
- how you will measure improvements to the service
